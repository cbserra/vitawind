# Why Vitawind

Vitawind is a Vite helper that can install and configure Tailwind CSS in just a few steps. Easy to use, just install Vitawind, run the configuration command, import the generated CSS file, and you'll be on your way to the most fantastic developer experience!

## Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is the best frontend dev tool in my mind. Vite is really fast and convenient when your are devloping Vue or React projects. Like **Webpack**'s, Vite's [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) helps speed up development by deploying application updates without reloading browser or application state.
